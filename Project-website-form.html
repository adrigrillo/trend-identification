<h4>Background</h4>
This project should help to analyse time series data, which is  a special type of data with a time-value, such as seconds or timestamp, as x-value and any observed value as y-value.
For example the y-value can be a measured value like temperature or stock exchange data.
In a mathematical sense, data has several components. 
One component is the so-called noise, which describes random events or measurement errors. 
Another component is the season, for example for weather data the different time of the year. So in general the season component describes repetitive behaviour during the observation period. Furthermore, 
data can contain a trend, which describe how the data will develop beyond the measuring period.
In Fig 1 a synthetic time series data was generated with these three different components, a trend, random noise and seasonality.

<h4>Problem statement and motivation:</h4>
It is very useful to separate the trend and season from the time series. For instance, scientists investigating global warming are interested in the overall changes, or trend, in temperature and not so much in the seasonal changes. Another example application is medicine, where electrocardiograms suffer from patient's breathing and baseline wander, that cause the heartbeats to be shifted away. There it is more useful to consider the series without the long-term changes. The quality of the separation for each component allows easier analysis on the time series.
There are multiple ways to take apart time series recordings. However, none of them are considered the standard way and little research exists to compare the methods for different types of time series. Our goal is to systematically compare the different approaches to find the best one or to be able to give the best method for specific type of time series.

<h4>Research questions/hypotheses:</h4>
<ul>
<li>What are the best and most versatile approaches for trend identification and estimation in time series data?</li>
<li>What are the strengths and weak points of the different methods tested?</li>
<li>Is it possible to automatically select the best approach(es) for trend identification and estimation, based on the (statistical/frequency/etc.) properties of a time series and the specific problem domain and application?</li>
</ul>
