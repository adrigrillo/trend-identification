    <h4>Background</h4>
    This project should help to analyse time series data, which is a special type of data with a time-value, such as seconds or timestamp, as x-value and any observed value as y-value.
    The y-value can then be a measured value like temperature or stock exchange data.
    In a mathematical sense this kind of data consists of several components.
    One component is the so-called noise which describes random events or measurement errors.
    Another component is the season, such as time of year in weather data. 
    In general the season component describes repetitive behaviour during the observation period. 
    Furthermore, data can contain a trend, which describes how the data will develop beyond the measurement period.
    In Fig. 1 a synthetic time series data was generated with these three different components, a trend, random noise and seasonality.

    <p>
        A main topic of this project is to find trends, which can be split in two parts.
        The first part is the identification, which means finding out if a trend exists, while the second part is to estimate this trend.
        An estimation of a trend can be an equation like <i>x+5</i> or just a list of points. 
        This depends on the method that is used.
        Trends can have different shapes such as just a straight increasing or decreasing line or more complex curves like simple polynomials.
        An overview about the considered types of trend can be found in Fig 2.
        Different methods can either identify or estimate a trend, or do both.

    <h4>Problem statement and motivation</h4>
    <p>
        It is very useful to separate the trend and season from the time series. 
        For instance, scientists investigating global warming are interested in the overall changes, or trend, in temperature and not so much in the seasonal changes. 
        Another example application is medicine, where electrocardiograms suffer from patient's breathing and baseline wander, that cause the heartbeats to be shifted away.
        There it is more useful to consider the series without the long-term changes. 
        The quality of the separation for each component allows easier analysis on the time series.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are multiple ways to take apart time series recordings. However, none of them are considered the standard way and little research exists to compare the methods for different types of time series. Our goal is to systematically compare the different approaches to find the best one or to be able to give the best method for specific type of time series.
    </p>

    <h4>Methods</h4>
    <p>
        A lot of methods are able to detect or approximate a trend, but these methods perform differently depending on the influences of the trend, the seasonal component and the noise.
        Mostly common methods, such as regression, are covered with a couple more complex methods.
        An overview and a brief description of them can be found in the report.
        All of the methods are applied to each trend individually. This allows determining the best method for a trend type.
        These results are compared to find either the best overall method or a group of trends where specific methods perform well.
    </p>
    <p>
        An example analysis of the estimation methods on two different trends can be found in Fig 3 and Fig 4, in the bar chart on the right the distance to the original trend is measured, so the smaller the value, the better the performance.
        On the mixed polynomial trend most methods perform very well, but the Theil-Sen estimator performs very bad. While on the monotonic trend all methods performs comparable except for the discrete wavelet spectrum which performs worse.

    <h4>Research questions</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>What are the best and most versatile approaches for trend identification and estimation in time series data?</li>
        <li>What are the strengths and weak points of the different methods tested?</li>
        <li>Is it possible to automatically select the best approach(es) for trend identification and estimation, based on the (statistical/frequency/etc.) properties of a time series and the specific problem domain and application?</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Main outcome</h4>
    <p>
        The research results in the comparison of strengths and weaknesses of different methods for trend detection and estimation.
